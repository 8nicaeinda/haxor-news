However, TOAD-Pro is not a free software. You need to purchase a license from the official website[^1^] to use it. The price is $117 for a lifetime license that includes free updates and support. You also need to buy an ELM327 interface separately, which is a device that connects your car's OBD2 port to your computer's USB port. You can find many compatible ELM327 interfaces on Amazon or eBay.
 
Once you have the license and the interface, you can download TOAD-Pro from the official website[^1^] or from a trusted third-party source[^2^].

After installing TOAD-Pro, you can connect your ELM327 interface to your car and your computer, and launch the software. You will see a dashboard with various options and features. You can select your car's make, model, year, and engine type, and then scan for any issues or faults.

TOAD-Pro is not only a car diagnostic software, but also a car tuning and modification software. It allows you to access and modify the ECU (Engine Control Unit) of your car, which is the computer that controls various aspects of your car's performance. You can change settings such as fuel injection, ignition timing, idle speed, throttle response, and more. You can also reset or clear any codes or errors that might affect your car's performance.
 
However, modifying the ECU of your car is not a simple task. You need to have some knowledge and experience in car mechanics and electronics. You also need to be careful not to damage your car or void your warranty by making unauthorized changes. TOAD-Pro provides you with some guides and tutorials on how to tune and modify your car safely and effectively, but you should always do your own research and consult a professional before making any changes.
