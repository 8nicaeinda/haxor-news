Pitch Monster 1.2.1 is the latest version of the plugin, which adds some improvements and bug fixes. Some of the new features include:
 
- A new "Wide" mode that spreads the voices across the stereo field for a bigger sound.
- A new "Random" mode that adds subtle variations to the pitch and time of each voice for a more natural and organic sound.
- A new "Formant" knob that controls the amount of formant shifting applied to the sound, allowing you to change the gender or species of a voice.
- A new "Mix" knob that blends the dry and wet signals for parallel processing.
- A new "MIDI Learn" button that lets you assign any MIDI controller to any parameter of the plugin.

Pitch Monster 1.2.1 also fixes some issues with compatibility, stability, and performance. It is available for Windows and Mac in VST 2, VST 3, AudioUnit and Protools 64-bit AAX Native formats. It supports Apple Silicon and has a low-latency DSP engine.

Pitch Monster 1.2.1 has three different engines that you can choose from: Granular, Formant, and Vocoder. Each engine has its own unique sound and features that can be adjusted with the knobs and sliders on the interface.
 
The Granular engine uses a granular synthesis technique to slice the input sound into tiny grains and rearrange them in time and pitch. This creates a wide range of effects, from subtle choruses and flangers to glitchy stutters and time-stretches. You can control the size, shape, density, and randomness of the grains, as well as the pitch shift amount and direction.
 
The Formant engine uses a formant synthesis technique to manipulate the spectral envelope of the input sound. This changes the timbre and character of the sound, making it sound like a different vowel, gender, or even species. You can control the formant shift amount and direction, as well as the pitch shift amount and direction.
 
The Vocoder engine uses a vocoder synthesis technique to modulate the input sound with a carrier signal. This creates a robotic or musical effect, depending on the carrier signal. You can use an internal noise or sawtooth oscillator as the carrier, or use an external audio input from another track. You can control the number of bands, the bandwidth, the envelope follower speed, and the pitch shift amount and direction.
 
Pitch Monster 1.2.1 also has some global features that apply to all engines. You can use the Chord mode to select up to eight notes on the on-screen keyboard to form a chord. This mode can be used to harmonize or add higher or lower energy to a sound. You can also use the MIDI mode to control the pitch shift amount with a MIDI keyboard or controller. You can save and recall chords for live performance using the eight chord memory slots. You can also copy chords to other instances of the plugin or edit them.
 
Pitch Monster 1.2.1 also has a dual high + low pass filter for fine tonal control, a mix knob for parallel processing, a wide mode for big stereo effects, and a random mode for subtle variations. It also has a responsive and low-latency DSP engine that can handle up to 64 voices of polyphony.
